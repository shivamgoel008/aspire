/// The single replica relay session inside a terminal host process. Each

/// — replica fan-out happens at the process level, not inside the host. The
/// replica's identity (which parent-resource replica it serves) is encoded in
/// the UDS paths and is opaque to the host.
///
/// The replica owns a recycle loop that builds successive <see cref="Hex1bTerminal"/>
/// instances over the lifetime of the host process.
///
/// Each iteration of the loop:
/// <list type="number">
///   <item>Builds a fresh Hex1bTerminal that LISTENS on the producer UDS and
///         serves on the consumer UDS.</item>
///   <item>Waits for DCP (the upstream PTY owner) to DIAL the producer UDS.
///         When that connection is accepted, <see cref="ProducerConnected"/>
///         flips to <c>true</c>.</item>
///   <item>Forwards bytes between producer and any number of viewers (Dashboard,
///         CLI) via Hex1b's HMP v1 multiplexing.</item>
///   <item>When the producer disconnects (process exit, transport error, etc.)
///         the inner <see cref="Hex1bTerminal.RunAsync(CancellationToken)"/>
///         returns. The terminal is disposed (which releases the UDS bindings
///         and tears down any attached viewer sessions), <see cref="LastExitCode"/>
///         is updated, <see cref="RestartCount"/> is incremented, and the loop
///         iterates to bind the same UDS paths again — ready for DCP to relaunch
///         the underlying process and dial back in.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Connection direction note: the producer side has the terminal host LISTENING
/// and DCP DIALING, not the other way around. This guarantees the host is
/// receiving from the very first byte the PTY emits, and also lets the host
/// recycle without DCP having to re-coordinate; DCP just dials the same path
/// again and Hex1b's existing connect-retry semantics on the producer side
