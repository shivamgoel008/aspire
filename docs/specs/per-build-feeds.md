# Per-build static NuGet feeds for the Aspire CLI

## TL;DR

Today the Aspire CLI resolves NuGet packages through five different
channel-specific code paths: nuget.org for stable; a shared rolling
`dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet9` feed for daily; a SHA-derived
`darc-pub-microsoft-aspire-<sha>` feed for staging (only synthesizable
on stable-quality CLIs); a GitHub-Actions-artifact-plus-local-hive
scheme for PRs (via `gh run download`); and a `~/.aspire/hives/*/packages`
sideload for local. Resolution depends on the CLI's baked identity,
the project channel, feature flags, override config, and the CLI
version's commit hash, with quality-matrix fan-out behind it.

This spec replaces all five with **one** code path. Every Aspire CI
build — PR, main, release/\*, GA — publishes a complete, immutable,
static NuGet v3 feed to public Azure Blob storage at a per-build URL.
The existing channel names (`daily`, `staging`, `pr-1234`, etc.) keep
working but now resolve through small mutable **pointer files** that
name the current per-build feed URL for that channel. The CLI's job
collapses to "fetch pointer file → use the URL it names." Almost all
of today's channel-resolution machinery — the quality matrix, staging
synthesis gating, SHA extraction, PR hive discovery, local hive
sideload, override config keys — is then deletable.

## Why we're doing this

### The current model is the single largest source of late-stage
### shipping bugs

The packaging service and channel resolver are the area of the CLI
most likely to break a release at the last mile. Concretely:

- **Channel resolution is context-dependent.** What `channel: "daily"`
  resolves to depends on the CLI's baked identity channel, project
  channel, feature flags, override config, *and* the CLI version's
  commit hash. There are too many inputs that interact non-obviously.
- **Some channels are conditionally synthesizable.** The `staging`
  channel only works on CLIs whose identity is `stable`, because the
  underlying SHA-specific feed only exists for stable-quality builds.
  A daily or PR CLI cannot deterministically resolve `staging` — a
  recurring shipping bug that we've gated, worked around, and
  reintroduced multiple times.
- **The `daily` channel is a shared rolling feed.** A CLI from
  yesterday's daily silently sees packages from today's daily unless
  we pin. There is no per-build immutability for daily.
- **PR builds use a separate file-system mechanism** (install-prefix
  hives) discovered by string-matching on the CLI's process path. A
  parallel resolution path that has its own bugs and operational
  quirks.
- **`local` builds rely on `~/.aspire/hives/<name>/packages`**
  sideloading. Another separate code path.
- **The on-disk channel name persists, not the actual feed URL**, so
  the same `aspire.config.json` resolves differently depending on
  which CLI happens to be installed on a given machine.
- **Every escape hatch grew from one of these channel quirks.** A
  prerelease semver filter to deal with rolling daily; a staging
  pinning override; a SHA-extraction helper; a staging-feed override
  config key; a quality-matrix enum used for fan-out and filtering.
  These are not bad code; they are the right code for the wrong
  underlying model.

### The cost is paid by humans

- **Shiproom risk.** Late-cycle "I can't resolve staging from this
  CLI" bugs derail RC reviews, because we discover them when teams
  try to dogfood RC bits with a daily-channel CLI.
- **Contributor friction.** "How do I test the bits from this PR?"
  is an `gh run download` + hive-copy + path-prefix dance that
  requires the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated. Codespaces,
  fresh containers, and external contributors hit avoidable
  obstacles.
- **Polyglot AppHosts inherit the complexity.** TypeScript / Python /
  Go AppHosts read `aspire.config.json#channel` at runtime and have
  to be handed a usable `NuGet.config`; the resolution complexity
  shows up in `Aspire.Managed` too.
- **Time spent.** A non-trivial fraction of every release cycle is
  spent debugging channel-resolution edge cases instead of shipping.

### What we want instead

A model where:

- **There is one resolution story.** PR, daily, staging, stable,
  local — all five behave identically as far as the CLI is concerned.
- **A local PR build is testable the same way a staging build is.**
  Same code path, same config shape, same network behavior.
- **`aspire.config.json` says exactly what packages the project
  resolves**, so a project's package source is reproducible across
  contributors and CI agents.
- **Adding a new channel does not require new branches in the CLI.**
  Channel names become pure indirection; behavior lives in storage.
- **What ships to nuget.org is the exact bytes that were tested in
  staging.** No "we tested an RC and rebuilt for GA" risk.

## What we're going to do

### 1. Every build publishes its own static NuGet v3 feed

Every successful CI build — PR builds, daily main builds, release/\*
builds, GA stable builds — uploads its NuGet packages, laid out as a
complete static v3 feed (service index + flat-container layout), to
a per-build, **immutable** path in public Azure Blob storage. The
feed is anonymously readable; standard NuGet clients can use it as a
source directly with no auth.

A "feed" here is just a directory of files; there is no server, no
auth, no database, no service to operate. Per-build immutability
means an exact `<channel>-<runId>` path will return the same bytes
forever (or until retention reclaims it).

### 2. Channel names resolve through small pointer files

The `channel` concept in `aspire.config.json` stays. The set of
well-known names stays (`stable`, `staging`, `daily`, `pr-<N>`,
`local`). What changes is that each well-known name maps to a
small, mutable **pointer file** in blob storage that names the
current per-build feed URL for that channel:

```jsonc
// channels/daily.json (overwritten on each successful main build)
{
  "feedUrl": "https://.../builds/daily/<runId>/index.json",
  "version": "13.5.0-daily.42",
  "publishedUtc": "...",
  "signed": true
}
```

The CLI's resolver becomes essentially "fetch pointer, follow its
URL." That's it.

### 3. The `channel` field becomes polymorphic

`channel` in `aspire.config.json` (and the `--channel` arg) accepts
either a well-known name (the existing vocabulary) **or** a literal
`https://` feed URL. Well-known names go through the pointer-file
resolver; URLs are used verbatim with no resolution step. Power
users and CI can pin to an exact build URL when they need to without
inventing a new channel name.

### 4. The CLI's identity channel becomes a default, not a behavior switch

The CLI continues to bake its identity channel (`stable | staging |
daily | local | pr-<N>`) as assembly metadata, but its only role is
to provide a sensible default for `aspire new` / `aspire init` when
the user hasn't picked one. It no longer controls *whether* a channel
can be resolved or *how*. A daily CLI can resolve `staging` perfectly
fine because pointer files exist for every channel.

`local` is the exception: a local developer build bakes a `file://`
URL pointing at the developer's own
`artifacts/packages/<config>/Shipping` so `channel: "local"`
resolves to those bits without any network round-trip.

### 5. Channel config is two-tiered: local for projects, global for scaffolding

Resolution is two-tiered with command-line override on top:

- **Local `aspire.config.json`** (committed at the project / AppHost
  root): authoritative for commands that operate within an existing
  project — `aspire add`, `aspire update`, `aspire run` / `start`.
  A team commits `"channel": "daily"` (or a specific PR / build URL)
  and every contributor's CLI resolves the same packages.
- **Global `aspire.config.json`** (user-scoped): provides the
  default channel for scaffolding commands — `aspire new`,
  `aspire init` — so the user doesn't have to pass `--channel`
  every time. Falls back to the CLI's baked identity channel if no
  global config exists yet.
- **Command-line `--channel <v>`** always wins for the single
  invocation.

The existing `aspire config` command keeps its existing semantics:
`aspire config set channel <v>` edits the local file;
`aspire config set -g channel <v>` edits the global file. `<v>`
accepts a well-known channel name **or** a literal `https://` feed URL.

`aspire update --channel <v>` is special: if `<v>` differs from the
current local `aspire.config.json#channel`, `update` rewrites the
local file's `channel` to `<v>` as part of the update — switching
channels *is* what `update` means in that case. For C# AppHosts the
rest of `update` (bumping package references) then runs against the
resolved feed; for polyglot AppHosts the channel switch is itself
the update.

### 6. Promote-not-rebuild for staging → stable

In the per-build-feed world, the `staging` and `stable` pipelines
can collapse into a **single signed-bits pipeline** whose only
end-of-pipeline decision is *"do we also push to nuget.org?"*. The
nupkgs are identical bytes throughout.

- Release-branch build produces signed `*.nupkg` files once and
  publishes them to `builds/staging/<runId>/`. Those bytes become
  the staging feed.
- Soak / QA / shiproom runs against those exact immutable bytes;
  there is no separate rebuild for "RC" vs "GA".
- A gated promotion pipeline does a server-side blob copy from
  `builds/staging/<runId>/` to `builds/stable/<version>/`, flips
  `channels/stable.json`, and pushes the *same bytes* to nuget.org.
- The "did we test the right bits?" risk that today exists because
  staging and stable are technically separate builds disappears
  entirely. The bytes that ship to nuget.org are bit-for-bit the
  bytes that were soaked in staging.

The staging build is stamped with the prospective GA version up
front. **Per-build path isolation makes that safe**: every build
lives at a unique `builds/staging/<runId>/...` path, so two
candidates both stamped `13.5.0` live at completely separate URLs
and never collide on blob. `channels/staging.json` simply points at
the latest successful candidate; a rejected candidate's bytes
persist at their original URL as a forensic artifact but stop being
discoverable via the channel name. The version number can be re-used
on the next candidate.

The only remaining caveat is downstream NuGet caches: a developer
who pulled the rejected `13.5.0` from staging during the soak window
has those bytes cached locally and may need a `dotnet nuget locals`
clear after a recall. This is normal NuGet behavior any time the
bytes of a given `(id, version)` change. The CLI can help by
surfacing recall information in `aspire doctor` and optionally
clearing affected cache entries proactively.

Earlier RC milestones (where prerelease semver actually matters to
users) still pack with an explicit `--prerelease-suffix rc.N`-style
mode. Those builds are normal prereleases, not GA promotion
candidates, and follow regular NuGet versioning rules.

### 7. The acquisition scripts simplify and drop the `gh` dependency

Today `get-aspire-cli-pr.sh` shells out to `gh run download` to
fetch a PR's CLI archive and packages from GitHub Actions
artifacts. That requires the `gh` CLI to be installed and
authenticated on the user's machine — a friction point for anyone
on a fresh box, a Codespace without `gh`, or a CI agent lacking
GitHub auth.

With the public blob feed, every PR's archive and package feed lives
at plain public HTTPS URLs resolvable via `channels/pr-<N>.json`.
The acquisition scripts can use `curl` / `Invoke-WebRequest` only.
No GitHub auth, no GitHub-API rate limits, no `gh` install step in
Codespace / dev container setup, no `actions:read` permission
gotchas.

### 8. Stable defaults to nuget.org; blob feed is opt-in for stable

GA users keep resolving stable packages from nuget.org by default.
The pointer file `channels/stable.json` exists (so we can dogfood /
QA the stable build via the blob path), but a stable-channel CLI
only routes through it when the user explicitly opts in via a
global CLI setting. PR / daily / staging / local channels always
route through the blob.

## Why the simplifications follow

Once channels resolve through a single pointer-file lookup:

- **Channel quality matrix goes away.** `PackageChannelQuality`,
  `PackageChannelType`, and the fan-out logic across packaging
  service methods have no purpose; channels are just names that map
  to URLs.
- **Staging-synthesis gating goes away.** A daily CLI resolves
  `staging` the same way it resolves `daily`: by fetching a
  pointer file. The whole `IsStagingChannelSynthesisAllowed`
  family of checks deletes.
- **SHA-extraction from the CLI's own version string goes away.**
  The staging feed URL no longer depends on the CLI's commit hash.
- **The various staging-pinning / override config keys go away.**
  They exist today to work around the matrix; with no matrix,
  nothing to override.
- **The PR install-prefix hive scheme goes away.** PR resolution
  is `channels/pr-<N>.json`, same as everything else.
- **The `~/.aspire/hives/*/packages` discovery for local goes
  away.** `local` is a baked `file://` URL.
- **Prerelease semver filtering inside the CLI goes away.** Each
  per-build feed contains exactly the versions that build produced;
  there is no rolling feed to filter.

The expected outcome is a packaging subsystem of roughly an order
of magnitude less code than today's, with one dominant code path
instead of five branching ones.

## Security: how we keep this from becoming a supply-chain hazard

A blob path that NuGet clients trust is a high-value target. The
design has to assume an attacker will try to subvert it through:

- A leaked credential in CI.
- A malicious PR that modifies a build YAML to push to an
  unexpected blob path.
- A compromised CI agent.
- An orphaned long-lived SAS token.
- A typo in a role assignment.

The redesign aims for the property that **no single failure mode**
can cause Aspire users to install a malicious package without
leaving an auditable trail. Key principles, in order of importance:

### Build pipelines never hold blob credentials

The pipelines that produce nupkgs (the same ones contributors edit
in PRs today) only emit the same GitHub / AzDO build artifacts
they already emit. They have no credential capable of writing to
blob storage.

A **separate, locked-down publish workflow** holds the sole
blob-write identity. It is triggered by completion of the build
pipeline (GH Actions `workflow_run` on success; AzDO equivalent),
runs from the default branch only, and is therefore not
PR-modifiable: a PR can change the build YAML but cannot change
the publish workflow, because the publish workflow always runs
from `main`'s copy of itself.

The publish workflow computes the destination blob path from
**trusted-only** inputs (workflow name, run id, PR number from the
upstream run's API record), not from any field a PR author can
spoof. It re-validates artifacts before publish.

### Federated identity, never static credentials

Both GH Actions and AzDO authenticate to Azure via federated
workload identity (OIDC). No storage account keys, no SAS tokens,
no service-principal secrets anywhere in pipeline variables, repo
secrets, or files. Trust policies on the storage account bind
specific OIDC subjects (specific workflow files, branches, source
repositories), so even another workflow in the same repo cannot
mint a token the storage account will accept.

Per-build-kind identities are separately scoped: a PR-publish
identity cannot write to `builds/stable/...`; only the GA-promotion
pipeline can.

### Storage account hardening

- Account-key auth disabled at the account level.
- SAS token generation disabled at the account level.
- No anonymous public access at the account level; the single
  read-only container opts in to anonymous *blob* read (not
  container listing).
- Network rules restrict writes to known CI egress.
- Resource lock prevents accidental deletion.
- Blob versioning + soft delete enable recovery from an
  accidental pointer overwrite.
- Immutability policy on stable-build paths prevents tampering
  with shipped GA bits after publish.

### Pointer files are signed

Each `channels/<name>.json` pointer is signed with a Key-Vault-held
identity, and the CLI verifies the signature before honoring the
resolved URL against a baked allowlist of acceptable signer
thumbprints. A rotated or compromised signing key can be revoked
via a CLI update, without trusting blob storage to police itself.

An append-only pointer history under
`channels/<name>/history/<utcTimestamp>-<runId>.json` makes pointer
flips auditable and reversible.

### Provenance + visible audit

- SLSA-style build provenance attestations published alongside
  each feed and optionally verified by the CLI.
- `aspire doctor` surfaces the resolved feed URL, pointer signature
  subject, and provenance source — so a user or CI operator can
  audit exactly what the CLI just trusted.
- A periodic CI job diffs `channels/*.json` against the
  corresponding pipeline run history and pages out unexplained
  pointer flips.

### Read-path checks

- NuGet package signatures are verified the same way they are
  today against the existing trust roots.
- For PR builds (test-signed packages), the CLI surfaces a clear
  "test-signed feed" indicator.
- Pointer-file URLs are constrained to an allowlist of host
  patterns (known account + optional AFD fronting) so a hijacked
  pointer cannot redirect the CLI to an arbitrary domain.

This whole section is intended to be reviewed by .NET security
engineering before any blob is provisioned.

## Goals and non-goals

**Goals**

- One resolution code path that handles every channel identically.
- A local PR build is testable the same way a staging or GA build
  is.
- `aspire.config.json` is fully self-describing for package
  resolution: any CLI on any machine resolves the same packages.
- Bytes that ship to nuget.org for GA are bit-for-bit the bytes
  that were soaked in staging.
- The acquisition scripts have no GitHub-API dependency and need
  no auth.
- A clear, auditable security model for blob publish that survives
  a malicious PR or a compromised CI agent.

**Non-goals**

- We are not changing the `channel` vocabulary that users see;
  the existing names continue to work.
- We are not changing how NuGet itself works; we publish a standard
  v3 feed and let NuGet do its job.
- We are not adding a server, database, or API to manage feeds.
  Everything is static files in blob storage.
- We are not changing where stable packages live for GA users —
  nuget.org remains the default for stable.
- This proposal is **not** an implementation plan. It does not
  prescribe file paths, class names, MSBuild targets, pipeline YAML
  names, or migration ordering. Those are deliberately left to
  implementation time.

## Scope of impact (high-level)

What this design touches, broadly:

- **CLI packaging subsystem.** Substantial deletion plus a small
  new resolver and signed-pointer client. The bulk of the existing
  code becomes dead.
- **CLI commands.** `new`, `init`, `add`, `update`, `run` / `start`,
  and `doctor` all change behavior around channel inputs (per the
  two-tier config model above). `config` reuses its existing
  local-default / `-g`-global semantics.
- **`aspire.config.json` schema.** No new fields. `channel`'s value
  range widens to include literal `https://` URLs.
- **Polyglot AppHost runtime** (TS / Py / Go). They continue to
  read `channel` from `aspire.config.json`; the CLI hands them a
  materialized `NuGet.config` with the resolved feed.
- **Acquisition scripts.** `get-aspire-cli*.sh` / `.ps1` simplify;
  the PR variants drop their `gh` dependency.
- **CI / engineering system.** Build pipelines gain an artifact-emit
  step for the static feed layout (no new credentials). A new
  locked-down publish workflow is the sole holder of the blob-write
  identity and runs only from `main`. The staging and stable
  pipelines merge into one signed-bits pipeline with a gated
  promotion step.
- **Tests.** The existing packaging tests collapse dramatically;
  new tests cover the pointer-file resolver and the static-feed
  layout.
- **Infrastructure as code.** New IaC for the storage account,
  network rules, federated identity trust policies, retention /
  immutability rules, and signing-key vault — all reviewable in
  the repo.

What it does **not** touch:

- Resource model, AppHost APIs, dashboard, deployment, hosting
  integrations, or anything else outside the CLI's package
  resolution path.

## Open questions

These are decisions the implementation phase will need to make.
Recording them here so reviewers can challenge or constrain them
before we start writing code.

**Storage / infra**

- Storage account ownership: does this live in the existing
  `dotnetcli`-style tenant or a new dedicated account?
- Storage account region / CDN fronting strategy.
- Retention windows per build kind (PR, daily, staging, stable).

**Pointer files**

- Custom JSON pointer with metadata (signing, build id, published
  date) vs. literally hosting a NuGet v3 service index that
  redirects? The latter is simpler for NuGet but loses the metadata
  channel.
- Pointer-file caching policy on the CLI side: TTL, respect
  `Cache-Control`, user-visible bypass flag?
- Signing key: reuse existing NuGet signing identity or mint a
  dedicated pointer-signing identity for blast-radius isolation?
- Rotation cadence and breakglass procedure for the federated
  identity trust policies and the signing key.

**Polyglot AppHosts**

- How does `Aspire.Managed` running inside a TS/Py/Go AppHost
  inherit the resolved feed URL from the launching CLI? Env var?
  Regenerated `NuGet.config`? Both?

**Security model**

- Confirm fork-PR safety: no code path in the publish workflow
  can be reached from a fork PR's token.
- AzDO equivalent of GH `workflow_run` — confirm the
  source-pipeline-triggered release pipeline pattern provides
  the same "PR cannot influence destination" property.
- Provenance attestation format: SLSA in-toto vs. GitHub Artifact
  Attestations vs. AzDO native — pick one that the CLI can verify
  cheaply.
- Re-validation surface in the publish workflow: NuGet v3 layout
  check, signature check, expected-package-id allowlist — confirm
  scope.

**CLI UX**

- Exact path / name of the global `aspire.config.json` (likely
  `~/.aspire/aspire.config.json` on Unix and
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aspire\aspire.config.json` on Windows; needs to
  match the path the existing `aspire config -g` already writes
  to).
- `aspire add --channel <v>` semantics: same "rewrite local config
  when value differs" rule as `aspire update`, or strict one-shot
  override?
- Whether `aspire --version` and `aspire doctor` should surface
  a "from staging channel, not yet GA" banner when the resolved
  channel is staging but the version string looks GA, and a
  "this build has been recalled" warning when the resolved pointer
  carries a recall marker.
- Recall mechanics: `channels/staging.json` `recalled: true` flag
  vs. blob deletion (constrained by immutability) vs. a
  `recalled/` prefix. Pick one that's safe for users pinned to
  the literal build URL as well as users pinned to the channel
  name.
- Stable-channel opt-in: name of the global setting that flips a
  stable-channel CLI from nuget.org to the blob feed (working
  name `useBuildFeedForStable`).

**Migration**

- Cutoff CLI version below which we keep today's resolution path
  alive as a fallback for legacy `aspire.config.json` files.
- Coexistence window: how long both systems run in parallel before
  the legacy paths are deleted.

## Deliverable for the first iteration of this PR

This is a big, sprawling change with real implementation risk, so
the PR starts as **spec-only** to gather review and buy-in before
any code lands. The first revision of this PR contains a single
markdown file in the repo, at a path TBD (proposed:
`docs/specs/per-build-feeds.md`), with this spec in the shape it
lands here — **why** first, **what** second, **how** left to
follow-up commits in the same PR.

After the spec is reviewed and the approach is accepted, the same
PR will evolve to carry the actual implementation. The cutover
will likely break into independent, individually mergeable
sub-changes (storage account provisioning, separate publish
workflow, daily-channel cutover, PR-channel cutover, staging
cutover, stable cutover, staging/stable pipeline merge, deletion
of the legacy resolution code, polyglot cleanup) so risk can be
contained at each step. The exact sub-change list is left to the
implementation work and a tracking issue that will be filed
alongside it once the spec is signed off.
